# Sumerics

Sumerics is a touch enabled sensor application for doing numerical calculations on Windows 8+ computers. It is enhanced for the latest generation of Ultrabooks featuring various sensors and a touch screen.

The app is described in greater detail in two articles. One of these articles can be found on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/472698/Sumerics), the other has been published [by Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/sumerics-case-study).

## Installation

The application is distributed via Chocolatey. The source and installer binary can also be downloaded from GitHub.

## Screenshots
